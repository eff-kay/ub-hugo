I am a tinkerer at heart, I have dabbled in a lot of technologies ranging from embedded software to web dev, from hardware signals to the application UI and everything inbetween. Looking for a place where my esoteric knowledge in arts, hardware and software is fused into a hot amalagam. I think I might have found it. See interests and figure out the trend.
